**Zero-to-AI** is a collection of simple, well-commented Jupyter notebooks that teach you the *foundational skills of Artificial Intelligence* — step by step, without jargon.  
The goal: take you from **zero** to building with **AI** in a practical, hands-on way.

## 📂 Contents  

### Current Notebooks:  
- **1.[Encoding & Decoding with Tokenizers](./Encoder_Decoder_Jashank.K.ipynb)**  
  Learn how LLMs translate human text into tokens (numbers) and back into readable text.  
  Covers:  
  - Loading a tokenizer  
  - Encoding input text into tokens  
  - Decoding tokens back into text  
  - Why this process is the backbone of all LLMs  

###🔄 **Upcoming Notebooks:** 
- LLM basics
- Fine-tuning basics  
- Prompt engineering workflows  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines  
- Building simple AI apps with LangChain  
- And more…  


## 🎯 Who This Is For  
- **Students** exploring AI for the first time  
- **Early-career professionals** looking to upskill  
- **AI practitioners** needing refreshers or new perspectives  


## 🛠 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository or open a notebook directly in **Google Colab**.  
2. Install dependencies (listed at the top of each notebook). For example:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers langchain
3. Enjoy!
