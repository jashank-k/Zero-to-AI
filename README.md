**Zero-to-AI** is a collection of simple, well-commented Jupyter notebooks that teach you the foundational skills of Artificial Intelligence — step by step, without jargon.  
The goal: take you from **Zero** to building with **AI** in a practical, hands-on way.  

## 📂 Contents  

### Current Notebooks:  
**1.[Encoding & Decoding with Tokenizers](1_Encoder_Decoder_ZeroToAI_Jashank.ipynb)**  
  Learn how LLMs translate human text into tokens (numbers) and back into readable text.  
  
**2.[Building a Simple Language Model](2_Building_Simple_LM_ZeroToAI_Jashank.ipynb)** 
  Learn how to build a complete, functional language model pipeline locally - No GPU Required  

**3.[Building a Simple RAG Application](3_Simple_RAG_LM_ZeroToAI_Jashank.ipynb)** **✨NEW!✨** 
Covers:  
- Chunking documents and retrieving relevant context using **TF-IDF**.  
- Building prompts that combine retrieved context with user questions.  
- Generating grounded answers with **Phi-2**, along with citations.
