**Zero-to-AI** is a collection of simple, well-commented Jupyter notebooks that teach you the foundational skills of Artificial Intelligence — step by step, without jargon.  
The goal: take you from **Zero** to building with **AI** in a practical, hands-on way.  

## 📂 Contents  

### Current Notebooks:  
**1.[Encoding & Decoding with Tokenizers](1_Encoder_Decoder_ZeroToAI_Jashank.ipynb)**  
  Learn how LLMs translate human text into tokens (numbers) and back into readable text.  
  
**2.[Building a Simple Language Model]()**  
  Learn how to build a complete, functional language model pipeline locally (on your own computer)- No GPU Required  
  Covers:  
  - Loading a pretrained language model and tokenizer.  
  - Setting up a local text generation pipeline.  
  - Asking questions and receiving generated text responses.

### 🔄 **Upcoming Notebooks:** 
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline basics
- Fine-tuning basics  
- Prompt engineering workflows  
- Building simple AI apps with LangChain
- Gen AI vs Agentic AI  
- And more…  


### 🎯 Who This Is For  
- **Students** exploring AI for the first time  
- **Early-career professionals** looking to upskill  
- **AI practitioners** needing refreshers or new perspectives  


### 🛠 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository or open a notebook directly in **Google Colab**.  
2. Install dependencies (listed at the top of each notebook). For example:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers langchain
3. Enjoy!
